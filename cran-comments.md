## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Updated citation formatting in the Description file to include the year.

* Put the name of the package in single quotes in the Description. 

Please note that, in the description, the acronym "FAVA" is defined and "Fst" is not an acronym. Fst is a standard population-genetic statistic. 

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 notes

* This is a new release.
