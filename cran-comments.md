## Resubmission
This is a patch to an existing package. In this patch I have: 

* Fixed one small bug which emerged when groups were numeric for `bootstrap_fava`

* Updated references to the corresponding paper, which has now been published in PNAS but was formerly a bioRxiv preprint

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 notes

* This is a new release.
