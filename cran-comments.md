## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Removed an example dataset of class "phyloseq" that could not be loaded on some platforms. 

* Updated the example for the function `relab_phyloseq` so that it instead uses data directly from the phyloseq package instead of relying on exported data.


## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.
