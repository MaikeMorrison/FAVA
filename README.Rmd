# FAVA

The _FAVA_ R package implements the statistic FAVA, an FST-based Assessment of Variability across vectors of relative Abundances, as well as a suite of helper functions which enable the visualization and statistical analysis of relative abundance data. The _FAVA_ R package accompanies the paper, "Quantifying compositional variability in microbial communities with FAVA" by [Morrison et al. (2025)](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2413211122).

The _FAVA_ R package includes the following core functions:

* `fava`: Quantify variability across many compositional vectors in a single, normalized index, called FAVA

* `bootstrap_fava`: Compare values of FAVA between pairs of abundance matrices

* `window_fava`: Compute FAVA in sliding windows along the rows of a relative abundance matrix

* `plot_relabund`: Visualize a relative abundance matrix as a stacked bar plot


## Installation

FAVA is available for [download on CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/FAVA/index.html). Install FAVA with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("FAVA")
```

If you find a bug, check [Issues](https://github.com/MaikeMorrison/FAVA/issues) to see if it has been identified already. If it has not yet been identified, please open an issue describing the bug and providing a minimal example. If it has already been identified, it will be fixed in the next CRAN release. In the meantime, you can install the development version of FAVA from [GitHub](https://github.com/MaikeMorrison/FAVA) with the following code:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# First, install devtools if you haven't already:
# install.packages("devtools")

devtools::install_github("MaikeMorrison/FAVA@CRAN_development")

```

## Tutorial

The package website, [maikemorrison.github.io/FAVA/](https://maikemorrison.github.io/FAVA/), contains documentation and examples for all package functions. It also contains a tutorial on the usage of _FAVA_ for the analysis of microbiome data. The tutorial vignette is available at [this link](https://maikemorrison.github.io/FAVA/articles/microbiome_tutorial.html).
