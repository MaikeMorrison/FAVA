# FAVA

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The _FAVA_ R package implements the statistic FAVA, an $F_{ST}$-based Assessment of Variability across vectors of relative Abundances, as well as a suite of helper functions which enable the visualization and statistical analysis of relative abundance data. The _FAVA_ R package package accompanies the paper, "FAVA: a tool to quantify compositional variability in microbial communities" by Morrison et al. (2023?).

The _FAVA_ R package includes the following core functions:

* `fava`: Quantify variability across many compositional vectors in a single, normalized index, called FAVA

* `bootstrap_fava`: Estimate the uncertainty in FAVA by generating bootstrap replicates of one or more relative abundance matrices and computing FAVA for each replicate matrix

* `window_fava`: Compute FAVA in sliding windows along the rows of a relative abundance matrix

* `plot_relabund`: Visualize a relative abundance matrix as a stacked bar plot


## Installation

You can install the development version of FAVA from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("MaikeMorrison/FAVA", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

## Tutorial

A tutorial on the usage of _FAVA_ with a focus on the analysis of compositional data representing microbiome samples is available in the `microbiome_tutorial` vignette, which is available at THIS LINK or via the following code after package installation. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
vignette("microbiome_tutorial", package = "FAVA")
```
