# FAVA

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The _FAVA_ R package implements the statistic FAVA, an $F_{ST}$-based Assessment of Variability across vectors of relative Abundances, as well as a suite of helper functions which enable the visualization and statistical analysis of relative abundance data. The _FAVA_ R package accompanies the paper, "Quantifying compositional variability in microbial communities with FAVA" by Morrison et al.

The _FAVA_ R package includes the following core functions:

* `fava`: Quantify variability across many compositional vectors in a single, normalized index, called FAVA

* `bootstrap_fava`: Compare values of FAVA between pairs of abundance matrices

* `window_fava`: Compute FAVA in sliding windows along the rows of a relative abundance matrix

* `plot_relabund`: Visualize a relative abundance matrix as a stacked bar plot


## Installation

You can install FAVA from [GitHub](https://github.com/MaikeMorrison/FAVA) with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}

# First, install devtools if you haven't already:
# install.packages("devtools")

devtools::install_github("MaikeMorrison/FAVA")

# If you wish to access the tutorial (also accessible below) from within
# the package:

devtools::install_github("MaikeMorrison/FAVA", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

## Tutorial

A tutorial on the usage of _FAVA_ with a focus on the analysis of compositional data representing microbiome samples is available in the `microbiome_tutorial` vignette, which is available at [this link](https://maikemorrison.com/files/microbiome_tutorial.html) or via the following code after package installation. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
vignette("microbiome_tutorial", package = "FAVA")
```
