The _FAVA_ R package implements the statistic FAVA, an $F_{ST}$-based Assessment of Variability across vectors of relative Abundances, as well as a suite of helper functions which enable the visualization and statistical analysis of relative abundance data. The _FAVA_ R package accompanies the paper, "Quantifying compositional variability in microbial communities with FAVA" by [Morrison et al. (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.07.03.601929).

The _FAVA_ R package includes the following core functions:

* `fava`: Quantify variability across many compositional vectors in a single, normalized index, called FAVA

* `bootstrap_fava`: Compare values of FAVA between pairs of abundance matrices

* `window_fava`: Compute FAVA in sliding windows along the rows of a relative abundance matrix

* `plot_relabund`: Visualize a relative abundance matrix as a stacked bar plot


## Installation


<!-- Install FAVA with: -->

<!-- ```{r, eval = FALSE} -->
<!-- install.packages("FAVA") -->
<!-- ``` -->


FAVA will be available on CRAN soon. In the meantime, you can install the development version of FAVA from [GitHub](https://github.com/MaikeMorrison/FAVA) with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# First, install devtools if you haven't already:
# install.packages("devtools")

devtools::install_github("MaikeMorrison/FAVA")

# If you wish to access the tutorial (also accessible below) from within
# the package:

devtools::install_github("MaikeMorrison/FAVA", build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

## Tutorial

The package website, [maikemorrison.github.io/FAVA/](https://maikemorrison.github.io/FAVA/), contains documentation and examples for all package functions. It also contains a tutorial on the usage of _FAVA_ for the analysis of microbiome data. The tutorial vignette is available at [this link](https://maikemorrison.github.io/FAVA/articles/microbiome_tutorial.html) or via the following code after package installation. 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
vignette("microbiome_tutorial", package = "FAVA")
```
