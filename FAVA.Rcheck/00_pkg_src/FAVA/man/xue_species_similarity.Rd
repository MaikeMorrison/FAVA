xue_species_similarity
}
\description{
A similarity matrix, with entry (i,j) corresponding to the pairwise similarity
between species i and species j. This similarity matrix was derived from a
phylogenetic distance matrix, inferred from the tree xue_species_tree,
using the expression s(i,j) = exp(-d(i,j)), where d(i,j) is the phylogenetic
distance between species i and j.
