Description: Implements the statistic FAVA, an Fst-based Assessment of Variability across 
  vectors of relative Abundances, as well as a suite of helper functions which enable the 
  visualization and statistical analysis of relative abundance data. The 'FAVA' R package 
  accompanies the paper, “Quantifying compositional variability in microbial communities
  with FAVA” by Morrison, Xue, and Rosenberg (2025) <doi:10.1073/pnas.2413211122>.
